"""Collect results — compose material layers onto the original scene.

Provides two composition strategies:

1. ``apply_and_compose()`` (preferred for scene mode):
   Merges predictions from all per-asset runs and applies materials in a
   single pass against the master scene USD. This produces correct bindings
   for instanced prims because the master stage has the real reference /
   instance structure.

2. ``compose_material_layers()`` (legacy):
   Sublayers per-asset material output layers over the original scene.

    For scenes where instances reference class-specifier prototype source prims

       source namespace.
    4. Authors the remapped bindings as overs in the composed layer.
